    "# ANSWER 7\n",
    "Common challenges in implementing K-means clustering and how to address them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization sensitivity: K-means can converge to different solutions based on initial centroid placement. Address this by running the algorithm multiple times with different initializations and choose the best result based on a clustering quality metric.\n",

    "Determining K: Selecting the appropriate number of clusters (K) can be challenging. Use elbow method, silhouette score, or other validation techniques to find an optimal K.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling outliers: K-means is sensitive to outliers, which can distort cluster centroids. Preprocess data to remove or down-weight outliers, or consider using other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN that are more robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-spherical clusters: K-means assumes spherical clusters, so it may not work well on irregularly shaped data. Consider using algorithms like DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models for such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-dimensional data: K-means may struggle with high-dimensional data due to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" Use techniques like dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) before applying K-means or opt for subspace clustering algorithms."
